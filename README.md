# Controlling-a-Machine-using-arduino

this project was to controll a machine brakes. in this system we have arduino uno. 2 Limit Switches, 2 push buttons, Keypad 4*4 

1 – there are tow branches every branch has tow switches (on/off switch, limitswitch)

2 – if you change the state of any on/off switch to ON you can choose the branch(right, left) from the
keypad (‘#’ for right branch , ‘*’ for left branch) after choosing the branch you can choose the
number of rotation

3 – after choosing the number of rotation change the state of the limitswitch to ON to perform the
number of rotations

4 – if you change the state on/off switch to OFF for any branch it will return to zero position taking
into account the total number of rotation for the selected branch
